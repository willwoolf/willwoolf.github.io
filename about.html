    <p>
        I am a final-year Mathematics student at the University of Manchester with a strong interest in applied mathematics.
        I am an enthusiastic hard worker who thrives in challenging situations.
        I am also a competent problem solver and capable of working efficiently as part of a team.
        Over the course of my studies I have developed a strong foundation in mathematics, including multivariate calculus, numerical linear algebra, differential equations in modeling, scientific computing, and numerical analysis.
        I am also proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++, and MATLAB.

        I am currently working on a project in geometric numerical integration, which are numerical methods for solving differential equations which preserve some inherent property of the system.
        Please see my <a href="experience.html">Experience</a> page for my previously completed projects.

        I have put this website together to have all my information in one place. I hope you find it helpful.
